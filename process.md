# Our Process

RokkinCat works in a weekly iterative cycle. We make a plan for the week every
monday and spend the week executing that plan. These weeks can be one of three
different types of week: [research](#research), [execution](#execution), or
[refinement](#refinement). Clients recieve an invoice at the end of each week.

## Research 

At the beginning of every project, we work with our client to
create a list of all of the features that need to be completed. We assign each
of those items a completion week. If we do not know enough of the project
details to create a plan, we will suggest spending a week with the client and
their customers determining the features needed.  Our engineering team will
also spend the week prototyping features that have technical risk so they can
better architect their solution.

### Key activities:
* Customer interviews
* Client interviews
* App Wireframing
* Prototyping


## Execution 

Every monday, our team sits down with the client to create a plan
of action for the week. Once the plan is in place, the engineering team gets to
work crafting that section of the application. Heavy emphasis is placed on the
weekly meeting, as that is the forum for making changes to the existing plan of
action; software projects are always in flux as new information is learned.
Clients often need features built that they didn't initially plan for, more
customers may be using the application than expected, customers may hate a
feature that was built previously.  By reviewing the state of the project on a
weekly basis, and constantly re-planning, we can be flexible to the needs of
our clients.

### Key activities:
* Programming
* Risk mitigation
* Planning
* Feedback review

## Refinement 

Refinement weeks are for polishing the finished product, writing
documentation, training new client hires on the technologies, writing
additional tests, etc.  For especially long running projects, or projects that
were rushed out the door, there is often a list of tradeoffs that happened
along the way that would ideally be removed from the final product. Maybe we
had to rush out the group chat feature because of an investor meeting, or our
client didn't fully understand how they would moderate the community they'd
built. By planning for taking the time to fill in all of these cracks, we can
ensure a better finished product. Refinement weeks require extra time from our
clients to be avilable for face to face meetings so they can be as expressive
as necessary to bridge any gaps in understanding between our team and theirs.
**Every project has at least one of these weeks.**

### Key activities:
* Writing documentation 
* Writing automated tests
* Finesse changes to the product
* Focus groups
